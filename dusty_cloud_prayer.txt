I seek clarity in all things cloud, code and architecture.
400K, and the Chiang Mai mountainside await.

My penance today shall be this:

Ye though I walk through the valley of broken builds, thy affliction:

Through faith, ferverence and persistence I found:

Thus spoke the shell:

Today's work never ends. Let tomorrow's work be this:

Chiang Mai awaits; I will claim the mountain.

From the dust we rise, and to the dust we shall return.
Amen
