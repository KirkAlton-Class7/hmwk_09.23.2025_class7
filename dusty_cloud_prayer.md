## <i>On the Consummation of Github and the Dusty Cloud Prayer</i>
1   Bless my thoughts with <i>clarity</i>, <br>
in cloud above, code below, <br>
and architecture eternal. <br>
<br>

2   <b>My <i>penance this day</i></b> <br>
To wrestle with the gates of GitHub <br>
'Til my code findeth rest in the cloud <br>
<br>

3   <b>Yea though I walk through the valley of broken projects</b> <br>
Thy Mac is tormented by HTTPS,<br>
demanding tokens in vain.<br>
Yet by faith and persistence,<br>
<i>salvation</i> cometh through SSH.<br>

4   <b>Thus spoke the shell:</b></span> <br>
Verily, thy computer is like a <i>lady</i>; <br>
she must be guided gently unto a <i>righteous directory</i>.
```sh
cd class7_repos/homework
```

Then touch her, and a file shall spring forth.
```sh
touch just_like_that.md
```

Having touched her, thou shalt lay the pipe 
```sh
echo "# PIPE HER" > just_like_that.md
echo "Yes, right there." >> just_like_that.md
```

And lo, ye must first `git init`, then `git add` the fruits of thy labor. <br>
Lest ye forget to `git commit`, thy efforts be in vain. <br>
```sh
git commit -m "first commit"
```
Only then may ye `git push` unto her. <br>
<br>

5 <b>Todayâ€™s work hath no end;</b> <br>
diligence in failure begets consistency, and consistency begets the <i>fruit of deployment</i>.
<br>

6   <b><i>Lo, $400K, faithful Ling Ling, <br>
and the mountainside of Chiang Mai await.</i></b> <br>

7 <b>Go forth, thou shalt <i>conquer</i> the mountain.</b> <br>

<br>

8   <b>And from this day you shall pray:</b> <br>
<i>Deliver me from the <b>burning pit of Keisha</b>, where hope is turned to ash. <br>
Grant me the discipline to learn without ceasing, <br>
for knowledge giveth, and ignorance taketh away. <br>
Keep me not in the Red Ocean of strife, <br>
but guide me to the Blue Ocean of abundance. <br>
From the dust we rise, and to the dust we shall return. <br>
In <b>Chewbacca's</b> name we pray, <br>
Amen.</i>
