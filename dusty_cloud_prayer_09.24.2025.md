# The Dusty Cloud Prayer
### On the 23rd day of the ninth month, in the first year of our Class 7.

I seek mental clarity in all things cloud, code, and architecture.
$400K, Ling Ling, and the Chiang Mai mountainside await.

#### My penance this day
To wrestle with the gates of GitHub until my code finds a home in the cloud.

#### Ye though I walk through the valley of broken builds
Thy soul was tormented by GitHub HTTPS demanding tokens on Mac. Thine HTTPS login was in vain, but through faith, fervor, and persistence I found salvation in SSH authentication.

#### Thus spoke the shell:
Your computer is like a lady: you must guide her to the right directory 
```sh
cd class7_repos/homework
```

Then touch her
```shell
touch just_like_that.md
```

Before you pipe her 
```sh
echo "# PIPE HER" > just_like_that.md
echo "Yes, right there." >> just_like_that.md
```

#### Todayâ€™s work never ends.
Diligence in failure builds builds consistency. 

#### Chiang Mai awaits; I will claim the mountain.

#### From the dust we rise, and to the dust we shall return.
In Chewbacca's name we pray.

Amen
